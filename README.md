## Annotations

### Dependent variable

A dependent variable represents a quantity whose value depends on how the independent variable is manipulated.
y is often the variable used to represent the dependent variable in an equation.

- Dependent variable will always go into the Y axis

### Independent variable

An independent variable is a variable that represents a quantity that is being manipulated in an experiment.
x is often the variable used to represent the independent variable in an equation.

### [Scatter Plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scatter_plot)

Scatter Plot with very week relationship will be accumulated in near to a single point.

Data points can have undue influence.

#### Scatter Plot Matrix

A scatter plot matrix is a grid (or matrix) of scatter plots used to visualize bivariate relationships between combinations of variables. Each scatter plot in the matrix visualizes the relationship between a pair of variables, allowing many relationships to be explored in one chart.

Mean vs Median

- If data is normally distributed the mean and the median will be quite close

- If Mean is larger than the mean, then it means that there there is a positive skew
  - Skewness will be bigger than 1
